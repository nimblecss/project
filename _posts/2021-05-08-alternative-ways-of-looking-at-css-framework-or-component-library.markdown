There are many, many CSS frameworks.

Here's a list of the most popular ones that come to mind:
* Bootstrap
* Bulma
* Tailwind
* MDL
* Semantic UI
* Halfmoon
* Tachyons

How many component libraries are there?

Here's a list of the most popular ones that come to mind:
* Shoelace
* Elix
* Framework-related (Vuetify, Vuefy, Buefy, ng-bootstrap, StoryBook)

Funnily, it seems that there are no "regular" projects where you could just copy-paste HTML code with some default CSS classes, ready to be tweaked, improved, and adjusted.

So that's what Nimble CSS is going to be.

Nimble CSS will fill this niche.

The purpose of Nimble CSS is to provide HTML components that are:
* plug-and-play, 
* semantic, 
* custom and customizable,
* use no JavaScript (styled purely with CSS),
* cover a wide range of "niche" structures (such as a mega menu)

Another goal is:
* make customization as painless as possible
